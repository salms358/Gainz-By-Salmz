    There is a picture of how to do the plank as well as a step by step guide to ensure the excersise done properly which would lead to better results in the future.

    There is also a guide to do squats with good form. I chose these excersises as growing up I was taught that they were the 2 most essential excersises when starting out. 

    Moreover, these exercises can be adapted to be made harder for people who are more experienced.
