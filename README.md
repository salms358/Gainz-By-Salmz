  # Testing 

    The website was working the same across Microsoft edge, firefox and google chrome.

      The website had colours that can easily be told apart from so it is easier for users to navigate around the page.

      The form is validated the submit button leads to the opening of the code institute 'congratulations' page. Moreover,
    if the user misses out on a field the form cannot be submitted and the user will be told to complete the field they missed out on for their form to be submitted.


    ## Validator testing
    -I conducted an HTML validation check where the HTML had no errors. 

    - CSS and HTML had a lot of indenting problems when first tested.

    -My HTML was also valid but it had a few warnings about including more headings.

    -Initially, my HTML included a lot of problems which I had to fix one by one a lot of the issues being to do with stray tags.

    -My code obtained a relatively high accessibility score (94%) showing that it is easy for users to navigate around the website. 

    -The performance skill as a whole says 38% despite meeting 35 of the 40 checks I concluded that it was because of the youtube video I added.

  # Fixed Bugs 
    -Menu disappeared when the screen was changed to a mobile format which was resolved by adding the override x.
    -Social media buttons were out of place I used margin-left to ensure that the social media buttons were in place. 
    -My hero image was too big which led to horizontal scrolling to combat this I centred my image and increased the width to 100% so it takes up the whole page.
    
  # Known Bugs 
    -One of the circular images moves slightly out of place when the screen is set to tablet format.
  
 # Languages 
    -HTML
    -CSS

 # Wireframe
  -Wireframe when first planning the website.
